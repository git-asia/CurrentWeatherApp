# CurrentWeatherApp
## Simple app with a few useful functionalities.

It allows you to:
- check the weather by your location
- check the weather in given place in the world.

The weather information contains of:
- Temperature (feels like, min, nax)
- Cloudiness
- Wind speed
- Wind direction
- Humidity
- Air pressure
- Sun rise and sun set time

I have used Open Weather API.
Units are metric.
Wind direction is converted from degrees to direction name.
Sunrise and sunset are converted to local time (hh:mm).

It is planned to add also One Call API with hourly to daily forecast.
